# Ankura

Ankura is an implementation of the anchor words topic modeling algorithm
described in Arora et al., 2013. My ultimate goal is to use this as a basis to
experiment with fine-grained topic models and improving token level topic
assignments. Fair warning though: this is research code and is subject to
frequent breaking changes and highly experimental code. In general I cannot
provide any support.

## Note on Fork

You may notice that this repo was forked from the byu-aml-lab. Please note that
this fork has diverged in several breaking ways. This was done solely to make
my life easier, without any intention to reintegrate with the main repo.

## Important Tags and Branches

* master - token level topic assignment experiments
* ankura2 - scalable topic based classification
* acl17 - interactive topic modeling with tandem anchoring
* xref - generates topic-based cross-references
